# Stones-n-Spells
This is a game which I began working on in high school. This code is my property and no permissions are directlty granted to any would-be users or viewers to redistribute the code or other resources contained within. I am creating this repository to document growth as a developer through college as I learn github and continue my ventures through java. This repository exists for the purpose of my education, and the documentation thereof.
If you are listed as a contributor, do not contribute without my permission. I have yet to acquire a teams github subscription, so if you commit without my permission, you will be removed from the repository.

### What even is the game?
The idea behind the game is that you are a dwarf wizard trying to escape a mine. The end-goal for the game is to create a roguelike where you start at the bottom in a central room and work your way up to the top. There are a guaranteed amount of chests on each floor with items that can be of help on your adventure. The structure of each floor is consistent, but the actual contents within each room are random. The exception to this rule is the room that you start in, and any boss room.
